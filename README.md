# E-Commerce Backend API

## Introduction
This project serves as the backend for an e-commerce application. It provides a set of APIs for managing various aspects of the e-commerce platform, including user authentication, product management, orders, payments, and social login integration. The application is built purely as an API, designed to be consumed by frontend applications.

## Background Story
The inception of this project traces back to my entrepreneurial journey that began in February 2023 when I ventured into launching a streetwear brand. As the streetwear trend gained momentum, I recognized the necessity for a robust e-commerce platform to support the brand's growth. Driven by youthful exuberance and a hunger for learning, I embarked on the ambitious task of developing the entire ecosystem from scratch.

During the initial phase, I immersed myself in backend development, navigating the intricacies of secure authentication and integrating payment gateways like Razorpay. Despite the challenges of being a 19-year-old entrepreneur, the brand's success was a testament to perseverance and determination. However, as with any journey, there were unforeseen hurdles, including misalignments with my co-founder, which ultimately led to my departure.

Amidst the ups and downs, one profound realization emerged â€“ my newfound passion for e-commerce applications. This project encapsulates not only the technical prowess gained but also the invaluable lessons learned from entrepreneurship.
